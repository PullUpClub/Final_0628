# üîß Current Issues Fixed

## **Issues Diagnosed and Fixed**

### **1. Critical: Missing `badges` Column in Profiles Table**

**Problem:** The code was trying to update a `badges` field in the profiles table that doesn't exist in the database schema.

**Evidence:** 
- Console error: `"Could not find the 'badges' column of 'profiles' in the schema cache"`
- Database schema analysis confirmed no `badges` column exists
- Code was trying to set `badges: []` in profile updates

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed `badges: []` from the profile update in `SignupAccessPage.tsx`
- Updated profile update to only include fields that exist in the database schema

**Files Modified:**
- `components/pages/Subscription/SignupAccessPage.tsx`

### **2. Chatbase Loading on Protected Routes (Fixed)**

**Problem:** Chatbase was being loaded globally on all pages, including protected routes like login, signup, and user dashboard pages where it's not needed.

**Evidence:**
- Chatbase was loaded in the root layout, appearing on all pages
- 401 errors on unauthenticated pages were unnecessary
- Performance impact on pages where support isn't needed

**Fix Applied:**
- Created `ChatbaseProvider` component that only loads Chatbase on specific public pages
- Removed global Chatbase loading from root layout
- Chatbase now only appears on: Home (`/`), Leaderboard (`/leaderboard`), Rules (`/rules`), FAQ (`/faq`), and Ethos (`/ethos`)

**Files Modified:**
- `app/layout.tsx` - Removed global Chatbase loading
- `components/Chatbase/ChatbaseProvider.tsx` - New targeted loading component
- `components/Chatbase/ChatbaseIdentity.tsx` - Updated to prevent 401 errors

### **3. Edge Function Rate Limiting (503 Errors)**

**Problem:** Multiple rapid calls to `verify-stripe-session` were causing rate limiting issues.

**Evidence:**
- Multiple repeated calls to `verify-stripe-session` in console logs
- Edge Function logs showed 200 responses but browser showed 503 errors
- This indicated rate limiting or network issues

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `isVerifying` state to prevent multiple simultaneous calls
- Added 1-second delay before making the first verification call
- Added proper cleanup and state management

**Files Modified:**
- `components/pages/Subscription/SignupAccessPage.tsx`

## **Database Schema Analysis**

**Profiles Table Fields (Confirmed):**
- ‚úÖ `id`, `full_name`, `age`, `gender`, `organization`, `phone`, `address`
- ‚úÖ `stripe_customer_id`, `is_paid`, `role`, `last_summon_at`
- ‚úÖ `created_at`, `updated_at`, `email`, `is_profile_completed`
- ‚úÖ `bio`, `avatar_url`, `apartment`, `user_settings`
- ‚úÖ `notification_preferences`, `theme_preferences`, `privacy_settings`
- ‚úÖ `street_address`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`, `country`
- ‚úÖ `social_media`, `pending_subscription_plan`, `last_viewed_page`
- ‚úÖ `session_data`, `admin_role_id`, `user_id`, `latitude`, `longitude`
- ‚úÖ `region`, `stripe_connect_id`, `stripe_onboarded`, `paypal_email`
- ‚ùå **`badges` - This field does NOT exist in the database**

**Badges System:**
- Badges are stored in a separate `user_badges` table (not in profiles)
- Functions exist for badge management: `award_badges_on_approval`, `refresh_badge_statistics`, `log_badge_assignment`
- This is the correct design pattern for badge management

## **Chatbase Implementation**

**New Targeted Loading:**
- Chatbase now only loads on public pages: Home, Leaderboard, Rules, FAQ, and Ethos
- No longer appears on protected routes like login, signup, profile, admin, etc.
- Eliminates unnecessary 401 errors and improves performance
- Still provides support where it's most needed (public pages)

## **Testing Recommendations**

### **1. Test Account Creation Flow**
1. Complete a test payment through Stripe
2. Verify redirect to `/signup-access` works
3. Test account creation with a new email
4. Verify no more "badges column" errors

### **2. Test Chatbase Integration**
1. Check that Chatbase appears on public pages (Home, Leaderboard, Rules, FAQ, Ethos)
2. Verify Chatbase does NOT appear on protected pages (Login, Signup, Profile, Admin)
3. Test Chatbase functionality for both authenticated and anonymous users on public pages

### **3. Test Rate Limiting**
1. Monitor console for multiple `verify-stripe-session` calls
2. Verify single verification call with delay
3. Check for any remaining 503 errors

## **Environment Variables Required**

### **Supabase Edge Functions**
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Stripe secret key for payment verification

### **Frontend**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_META_PIXEL_ID` - Your Meta Pixel ID
- `CHATBASE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Chatbase secret key

## **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy the fixes** to your production environment
2. **Test the account creation flow** end-to-end
3. **Verify Chatbase only appears on public pages**
4. **Monitor console logs** for any remaining errors

## **Files Modified Summary**

1. `components/pages/Subscription/SignupAccessPage.tsx` - Fixed missing badges column and added rate limiting protection
2. `components/Chatbase/ChatbaseIdentity.tsx` - Fixed 401 errors for unauthenticated users
3. `components/Chatbase/ChatbaseProvider.tsx` - New targeted Chatbase loading component
4. `app/layout.tsx` - Removed global Chatbase loading

All changes maintain backward compatibility and improve user experience while resolving the critical issues preventing account creation.
