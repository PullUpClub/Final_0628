# ðŸ”§ Issue Fixes Summary

## **Problems Diagnosed and Fixed**

### **1. Critical: Supabase Edge Function `verify-stripe-session` 500 Error**

**Problem:** The `verify-stripe-session` Supabase Edge Function was returning 500 errors, preventing users from creating accounts after payment.

**Root Cause:** The function was trying to access `Deno.env.get('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')` but this environment variable was likely not set in the Supabase Edge Functions environment.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added proper environment variable validation in `supabase/functions/verify-stripe-session/index.ts`
- Added detailed error logging and specific error messages
- Added console logging for debugging session verification process

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/verify-stripe-session/index.ts`

**Next Steps Required:**
- Ensure `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is properly set in your Supabase Edge Functions environment variables
- Deploy the updated function to Supabase

### **2. User Flow Issue: "User already registered" Error**

**Problem:** Users who already had accounts were getting "User already registered" errors when trying to sign up after payment, with no way to log in instead.

**Root Cause:** The `SignupAccessPage.tsx` didn't handle existing user scenarios and only provided signup functionality.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added logic to detect "User already registered" errors
- Added a login option that appears when this error occurs
- Added redirect to login page with session ID and email pre-filled
- Improved error handling and user feedback

**Files Modified:**
- `components/pages/Subscription/SignupAccessPage.tsx`

### **3. Multiple GoTrueClient Instances Warning**

**Problem:** Multiple Supabase client instances were being created, causing warnings and potential race conditions.

**Root Cause:** Two different Supabase client implementations were running simultaneously:
1. `lib/supabase.ts` - Singleton client using `createClient()`
2. `hooks/useAuth.ts` - New client using `createClientComponentClient()`

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `hooks/useAuth.ts` to use the singleton client from `lib/supabase.ts`
- Removed `createClientComponentClient()` import and usage
- Ensured single client instance across the application

**Files Modified:**
- `hooks/useAuth.ts`

### **4. Multiple Meta Pixels Warning**

**Problem:** Meta Pixel was being initialized multiple times, causing warnings and potential duplicate tracking.

**Root Cause:** Meta Pixel initialization was happening in multiple places without proper checks.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added global flag to prevent multiple initializations
- Updated `AnalyticsWrapper.tsx` to check if Meta Pixel is already initialized
- Added console logging for debugging initialization

**Files Modified:**
- `components/Layout/AnalyticsWrapper.tsx`

### **5. Content Security Policy (CSP) Violation for Facebook Frame**

**Problem:** Facebook content was being blocked by CSP, causing frame loading errors.

**Root Cause:** `https://www.facebook.com` was not included in the `frame-src` directive in the Content Security Policy.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `https://www.facebook.com` to the `frame-src` directive in `vercel.json`

**Files Modified:**
- `vercel.json`

## **Build Status**

âœ… **Build Successful** - All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
âœ… **No Linting Errors** - Code passes all linting checks
âœ… **All Routes Generated** - All pages and API routes properly configured

## **Testing Recommendations**

### **1. Test the Payment Flow**
1. Complete a test payment through Stripe
2. Verify the redirect to `/signup-access` works
3. Test account creation with a new email
4. Test the "User already registered" flow with an existing email

### **2. Test Supabase Edge Function**
1. Check Supabase dashboard for `verify-stripe-session` function logs
2. Verify `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable is set
3. Test the function directly in Supabase dashboard

### **3. Test Authentication**
1. Verify login/logout flows work correctly
2. Check that user sessions persist properly
3. Test profile updates and access control

### **4. Test Meta Pixel**
1. Check browser console for Meta Pixel warnings
2. Verify tracking events are firing correctly
3. Check for duplicate event tracking

## **Environment Variables Required**

### **Supabase Edge Functions**
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Stripe secret key for payment verification

### **Frontend**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_META_PIXEL_ID` - Your Meta Pixel ID

## **Deployment Notes**

1. **Supabase Edge Functions:** Deploy the updated `verify-stripe-session` function
2. **Environment Variables:** Ensure all required environment variables are set in both Supabase and Vercel
3. **Vercel Deployment:** The updated `vercel.json` will be automatically applied on next deployment

## **Monitoring**

After deployment, monitor:
- Supabase Edge Function logs for any remaining 500 errors
- Browser console for any remaining warnings
- User feedback on the payment and account creation flow
- Meta Pixel tracking accuracy

## **Files Modified Summary**

1. `supabase/functions/verify-stripe-session/index.ts` - Enhanced error handling and logging
2. `components/pages/Subscription/SignupAccessPage.tsx` - Added login flow for existing users
3. `hooks/useAuth.ts` - Fixed multiple client instances
4. `components/Layout/AnalyticsWrapper.tsx` - Fixed multiple Meta Pixel initializations
5. `vercel.json` - Fixed CSP for Facebook frames

All changes maintain backward compatibility and improve user experience while resolving the critical issues preventing account creation.
